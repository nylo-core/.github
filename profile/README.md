## About Nylo

Nylo is a Flutter Micro-Framework that's been built to make developing new Flutter apps a breeze. 

Out the box, Nylo solves many common tasks such as:

- [Routing](https://nylo.dev/docs/3.x/router).
- [Light and dark themes preset](https://nylo.dev/docs/3.x/themes).
- [Localization](https://nylo.dev/docs/3.x/localization).
- [CLI for generating project files](https://nylo.dev/docs/3.x/metro).
- [Elegant API Services for Networking](https://nylo.dev/docs/3.x/networking).
- [Creating App Icons](https://nylo.dev/docs/3.x/app-icons).
- [Project Configuration](https://nylo.dev/docs/3.x/configuration).
- [Streamlined Project Structure](https://nylo.dev/docs/3.x/directory-structure).

This makes building Flutter apps far quicker than from scratch and you can write your `Dart` code just as you would in any other Flutter project.
